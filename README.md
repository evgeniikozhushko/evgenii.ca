My name is Evgenii, welcome to my personal website.

I'm a designer and web developer based in Canmore, Alberta.

## Website Summary

This website is a modern and dynamic platform showcasing my expertise in web development and design. It leverages the following technologies and design principles:

### Tech Stack:

React & Next.js: For a seamless, component-based architecture, enabling efficient content fetching and rendering.

Contentful CMS: Used to manage rich text content and media, integrated via Contentfulâ€™s API for real-time updates and structured content handling.

TypeScript: Enhances code reliability with static typing, making the codebase more maintainable and scalable.

Tailwind CSS: Facilitates responsive and aesthetically pleasing design with utility-first CSS classes, ensuring rapid prototyping and visual consistency.

NextUI & React Icons: Provides a library of UI components and icons for a cohesive user interface, allowing for customizable and reusable elements.

### Design and Functionality Intricacies:

Rich Text Rendering: Custom rendering logic for various content types from Contentful, including embedded assets, lists, quotes, and hyperlinks, demonstrating in-depth handling of dynamic content.

Responsive Layouts: Implemented using Tailwind CSS and Flexbox, ensuring a fluid and adaptive design across different screen sizes and devices.

Interactive Elements: Integration of components like accordions and social media icons, utilizing React state management to create dynamic and interactive user experiences.

SEO Optimization: Built with Next.js's SEO-friendly routing and metadata, optimizing for search engine visibility.

Custom Animations: Subtle CSS transitions and hover effects add an engaging touch, reflecting a keen eye for user interface aesthetics.

This project not only showcases my technical proficiency with modern web technologies but also my ability to combine design principles with functionality to create an elegant, user-friendly website.
